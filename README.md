# learn-ML

## Motivations

This repository is a place where i will commit different projects, in order to learn some data science python library such as: 
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - pandas
 - scikit-learn
 - seaborn

What motivated me to learn these libraries, is the fact that the opportunities where i have to use python to manipulate data have increased lately for me, 
this is related to the fact that i am currently enroled (2021-2022) in a research oriented master's degree (in my last year).

Currently using Orange3 to do machine learning at University ( and Weka last year ), i am planning to replace these with other data science libraries.
